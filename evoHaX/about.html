	<p>He is a  professional Bee Keeper who loves to learn new things. He is currently a student studying Leadership Ethics and Organizational Sustainability & Entrepreneurship at St. Joseph's University. Eli was born unable to breath, requiring  resuscitation by the medical team. This event resulted in a brain injury leaving Eli with a condition referred to as Alexia. Alexia is the inability, due to cerebral damage, to comprehend or understand writing.
	</p><p>Eli uses attributes about a person like hair and height as contextual references to be able to recognize an individual. To give you Eliâ€™s perspective, please see below image which shows what people look like to him.

	<p class="h2">What is Alexia?</p>
<p>Alexia is a version of Dyslexia caused by brain injury resulting in an inability to understand written language whereas Dyslexia describes difficulty reading and writing. 
</p>
<p>There are many different types of Alexia that are broadly classified in Central Alexia and Peripheral Alexia. Alexia is common following strokes to the left side of the brain. 
</p>

<p class="h2">What causes Alexia?</p>
<p>Alexia is a rare condition which results in impaired reading and writing and associated disorders like Gerstmann's syndrome components (acalculia, finger agnosia, right-left disorientation), prosopagnosia (difficulty recognizing faces), as well as anomia (a form of aphasia in which the patient is unable to recall the names of everyday objects). The occipital lobe is the part of the brain which processes visual information, allowing you to see people, objects and surroundings. The temporal lobe works in association with the occipital lobe to interpret the things we see. Damage along the neuronal pathways for which this information travels is thought to contribute to development of Alexia and other associated disorders. 
</p>
<p class="h2">Who is diagnosed with Alexia?</p>
<p>As of 2015, 10.6% of the American population, ages 18 and older, suffer from Cognitive disorders. To put this in perspective, 1 in 5 American adults live with some form of disability like motor, cognitive, vision etc. 
 
</p>

<p>Each year, approximately 795,000 people suffer a stroke. About 600,000 of these are first attacks, and 185,000 are recurrent attacks.

<p>The image on the left was given to a patient with Alexia who then tried to copy the image and presented the image on the right. The patient was unable to copy the design accurately due to the disconnect between their occipital and temporal lobe. Similarly, below is an example of a patient with Alexia copying cyrillic alphabet (2nd line).

<p>Unfortunately, there is not a lot of information explaining the disorder commonly known as Alexia and more studies are necessary in order to contribute to a full and complete understanding of this disorder and treatment options.
