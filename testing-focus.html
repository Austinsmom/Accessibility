		<h2>Focus Findings</h2>
		<h3>Chrome on Mac (Webkit)</h3>
		<h4>No screen reader</h4>
		<p>If target doesn't have tabindex = -1 focus goes to <strong>body</strong> although it still <strong>scrolls</strong> to target container.</p>
		<p>(no difference between clicking and hitting enter)</p>
		<p>Subsequent tabbing will jump to the first element in tab order <strong>from the body</strong>.</p>
		<h4>Voice Over</h4>
		<p>Same as without VO.</p>
		<p>If target gains focus, content within target gets read.</p>
		<p>But, if you right-arrow through content it <strong>reads</strong> first content <strong>after the link</strong> you engaged.</p>
		<p>And, if you continue to right-arrow until you get to the next actionable element focus goes to that element and further tabbing originates from there.</p>

		<h3>Safari (Webkit)</h3>
		<h4>No screen reader</h4>
		<p>If target doesn't have tabindex = -1 AND you <strong>click</strong> on trigger focus moves to nearesst focusable ancestor (or maybe focusable wrapper -- I didn't check for if focusable container isn't overflow hidden).</p>
		<p>If target doesn't have tabindex = -1 AND you <strong>press enter</strong> on trigger (which has been tab focused) focus remains on trigger. In essence <strong>nothing happens</strong>.</p>
		<p>Subsequent tabbing will take you to the next element in tab order after whatever had focus post-action.</p>
		<h4>Voice Over</h4>
		<p>Same as pressing enter without screen reader</p>

		<h3>Firefox on PC (Moz) -- Best Experience</h3>
		<h4>No screen reader</h4>
		<p>Doesn't matter whether or not tabindex attribute exists on target.  Focus goes to body. And yet...</p>
		<p>Scroll does happen.</p>
		<p>And tab order homebase is the target. Yet focus is on body until tab.</p>
		<p>Basically, FF doesn't rely on focus in its solution.</p>
		<p>Works for both clicking and hitting return.</p>
		<h4>NVDA</h4>
		<p>Same as without screen reader</p>
		<p>Reads content of target whether or not it has tabindex = -1</p>

		<h3>IE</h3>
		<h4>No screen reader</h4>
		<h4>JAWS</h4>

		<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
		<p>Firefox handles internal links the way they should be handled.  It does not leverage focus to do this so tabindex isn't necessary unless focus is required for other reasons.</p>
		<p>BUT...since all other browsers require focus handling in order to approximate what FF is doing focus and tabindex = -1 will be required for the foreseeable future.</p>
